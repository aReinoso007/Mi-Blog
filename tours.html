                Hybrid Theory World Tour was the first concert tour by 
                American nu metal band Linkin Park. It was launched in 
                support of Linkin Park's debut studio album, Hybrid Theory (2000). 
                <br>
                The tour started on July 22, 2000 in St. Petersburg (Florida) and 
                ended on September 24, 2001 in Amsterdam. The duration of the tour 
                was almost half year. The tour consisted of four legs which made a 
                total of 57 shows. The promotion for the album was done by various 
                other tours like Deftones' "Back To School" Tour, "Ozzfest", "Family Values Tour", 
                "Countdown To Revolution Tour" and "Projekt Revolution" which the band headlined 
                or acted as a supporting act.

                The tour was never officially announced. But in an article by MTV named as Hybrid 
                Odyssey in honour of the album, the dates of all the shows by Linkin Park were included. 
                The same was announced in a documentary with the same name.

                The band started their tour as a support band. They first supported The Union 
                Underground in their An Education in Rebellion Tour, then supported Kottonmouth 
                Kings on their Ridin' High Tour (although three shows of this leg were cancelled), 
                then P.O.D. on their Kings of the Game Tour and finally Papa Roach on their Master Bay Tour. 
                The band also performed headlining shows and radio showcases when they had occasion.

                    The band's first headiling tour was named "Hybrid Theory European Promo Tour". 
                    It consisted of only five shows. All the shows in the leg were in Europe. 
                    The concert was played in France, Germany and England. The duration of the first 
                    leg was just four days. The leg was played for various events like "Nulle Part Ailleurs" 
                    and "BBC Radio One Evening Session". The first show in the tour was a promo show for Rock Sound Magazine. 
                    <br>
                    The second show by the band was Linkin Park's first TV appearance. The show by the band in London was aired by 
                    BBC. The song "Papercut" recorded while the show was made available as a special edition with the album.

            <cite>Styles of Beyond has finished their time on our tour, and we were all sad to see them go home. 
                They are really nice guys, and put on an excellent show. I heard they're going to go home to save 
                up some money and showcase for some more record labels, as they are as of yet an unsigned act.</cite>
